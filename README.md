This is a game called [Surf Waver](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/surf-waver).  It was made for Global Game Jam 2017.

It was made in under 48 hours by somebody who didn't know Phaser or SocketCluster before starting!

It is full of hacks and it is an amazement that it even works at all!

You should not use this code, or even look at it.

Instead, check out [the IOGrid framework](https://github.com/SocketCluster/iogrid) - this project is just hacks on top of that.
